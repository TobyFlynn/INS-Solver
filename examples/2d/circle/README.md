# Reinitalization of a circle

This is a test for the reinitalization algorithm. We have a perturbed level set
function exhibithing a wide range of gradients and the zero level set. 

The domain setup follows Ngu. [-2, -2], [2, 2] and the mesh refinement aims at
reconstructing the convergence figures for L1 norm and Linf norm.
